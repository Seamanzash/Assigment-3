// 1. hallow Equality Test:
//        - One-Dimensional Arrays: A shallow equality test for one-dimensional arrays of type int compares the references of the arrays,
//        rather than the actual content. It checks if the two array variables A and B refer to the same memory location,
//        indicating that they are the same array instance.



//        - Two-Dimensional Arrays: A shallow equality test for two-dimensional arrays of type int also compares the references of the arrays themselves,
//        not the individual elements.
//        It checks if the two array variables A and B point to the same memory location,
//        indicating that they are the same array instance.


//
//        2. Deep Equality Test:
//        - One-Dimensional Arrays: A deep equality test for one-dimensional arrays of type int compares the content of the arrays element by element.
//        It checks if the values stored in the arrays are the same, regardless of the memory locations.
//        The length and values of the arrays are compared to determine if they are equal.


//   - Two-Dimensional Arrays: A deep equality test for two-dimensional arrays of type int also compares the content of the arrays,
//   but in a multidimensional manner. It checks if the lengths and values of the rows and columns of the arrays match.
//   Each element in the two arrays is compared to ensure they have the same value.
